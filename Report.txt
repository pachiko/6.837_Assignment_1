- Always ensure triangle vertices are counter-clockwise. That also depends on sweep direction.
- Do not reinitialize binormals after each curve segment, but only at the beginning of a spline.
- Use basis matrices to interpolate splines. Faster and tidier.
- Creating a Vector4f from Vector3f requires a specific w-component. Do not leave it blank.
- The math trick for spline basis conversion can be applied to deriving the transformation of normals.

P = G_1B_1T = G_1B_1(B_2[-1]B_2])T;
G_2 = G_1B_1B_2[-1];

(N1.t)(T1) = 0
N1.t(M[-1] M)T1 = 0
(N1.t M[-1])(M T1) = 0
(N1.t M[-1])(T2) = 0
(N2.t)(T2) = 0

N2.t = N1.t M[-1]
N2 = (N1.t M[-1])t
N2 = M[-1]t N1
